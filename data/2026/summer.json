    "synopsis": "Seventeen-year-old Jirou Azuma lives a quiet life with his grandfather, utilizing his supernatural ability to speak with animals to befriend and protect them. Both Jirou and his grandfather are descendants of a long-standing shinobi clan, training in combat to keep the art of battle alive within their family. Jirou's life is thrown into upheaval after rescuing a seemingly normal black cat, Ragou, only to discover that the cat is actually a mononoke—a demonic spirit that has long been at war with mankind. When a hostile mononoke comes looking for Ragou, Jirou uses his shinobi training to jump to the cat's defense, but immediately suffers a mortal wound.\n\nFaced with the decision of whether or not to devour Jirou's fading energy and restore himself to full power, Ragou instead chooses to give his remaining energy to Jirou. Reviving the boy, the transfer also grants him great supernatural powers that complement his own shinobi fighting style. This act is witnessed by Ryousuke Shiba, an officer in the Bureau of Espionage whose job revolves around dispatching aggressive mononoke. Shiba extends Jirou and his grandfather an offer: to join the Bureau's new squad, Black Torch, and help them battle powerful mononoke who seek to devour innocent people.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Although human safety is barely being maintained, the world remains on the brink of collapse. As the threat of death and destruction lingers, people go about their daily lives by turning away from the constant danger around them. In response, the United Nations establishes EXCEEDS, an organization tasked with investigating and combating threats caused by the Invasion Species.\n\nThe story begins in the Far Eastern island nation of Mizuho, where Shiina Kuze, a young hunter who exterminates invasive species, lives on a remote island. Wanting nothing more than a quiet life with her only family—her younger sister, Setsuna—Shiina's routine is disrupted when an unexpected incident occurs, drawing her into a much larger conflict.\n\n(Source: MAL News)",

    "synopsis": "On an April night in Tokyo, still too early for fireworks, university student Kakeru Mano meets a woman named Koharu Fuyutsuki. She is a beautiful girl who stands out from the crowd, laughs a lot, and exudes a warmth that contrasts sharply with Kakeru's own introversion. But there was something Kakeru didn't know at first—she can't see. Unlike Kakeru, Koharu hasn't given up on anything, even with her blindness. She attends university daily, shows interest in clubs, makes friends—and dreams of launching fireworks one day. Kakeru wonders why, when she can't see them...but maybe it doesn't matter. And maybe he can start moving forward, too, for the girl who's always been by his side.\n\n(Source: Yen Press)",

    "synopsis": "Ai Yasumi, a first-year high school student living on Izu-Oshima, loves manga more than anything. When she learns that her long-admired, yet long-inactive, favorite manga artist Hoshi no Rei will be exhibiting at COMITIA, she sets off on a journey to Tokyo.\n\nWhat she doesn't expect, however, is that a fateful encounter at the event will change her life forever.\n\n\"How does one become a manga artist?\" Ai steps into the world of manga creation—a path she thought she understood, yet knows so little about. This is the story of a girl taking her first steps down the road to becoming a mangaka.\n\n(Source: MAL News)",
